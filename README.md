# set-game

A popular card game wherein players try to form 'sets' of cards based on their attributes.
Each card has symbols on it which have some combination of the following attributes:

1. shape : diamonds, ovals, or 'squigglies',
2. shade : transparents, shaded, or opaque,
3. color : purple, red, or green,
4. number: one, two, or three

A valid 'set' consists of three cards where all attributes are either the same or different...
In other words: If the three cards have the SAME shape and shade, but EACH ONE also has a distinct color and number, that's a set. 

It's easier to understand once you see it in action; here's a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc4WrL7cxeg.
